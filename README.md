# Superpower-style Landing (Next.js 14 App Router, TS, Tailwind, Framer Motion)

This is a clean starter that mirrors the uploaded reference:
- Video hero with overlay headline + CTA
- Scroll-reveal sections (How it works, Stats, Stories, What's included, What we test)
- Rounded pill nav, footer with wide word mark
- Responsive + mobile-first

## Quick start
```bash
pnpm i   # or npm i / yarn
pnpm dev # http://localhost:3000
```

## Notes
- Replace `/public/hero.mp4` with your real video.
- Replace placeholder images in `/public/images` as needed.
- Colors and copy live in `lib/config.ts`.
